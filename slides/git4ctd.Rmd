# What

---
class: middle

## Version Control

- Rollback

- Create branches 

    - Enable experimental changes 
    - Develop new ideas

---
class: middle

## Social Coding Sites

- Version Control for your files / documents / projects 

- Social Coding for collaboration



---

# Why


**Git** for version control

**GitHub** for collaboration, project management, and profile features

---
class: middle

## Version Control

- Works with **any files**.  Not just code (PDF, MS Office files, PNG, .Gif, .CSV, etc.)
- Local **directories** are **Projects** are  **Repositories**
- Can share a repo without GitHub
- [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (GLFS)
- Roll back in time
- **Fork It**

---

### Collaboration & Social Profiles

Bullet Proof Collaboration (Conflict Resolution)

- Collaborate with Permissions
- Pull Request Collaboration
- Anyone can collaborate when it's public
- Decision to accept is always up to the project owner(s)
